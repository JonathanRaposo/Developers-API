Description

I created this basic web app using the json-server api. I created the api myself for the backend and I used React for the frontend. The main idea was for me to practice full stack developement. You can clone this Repo to see it working. Just keep in mind that you have to npm install -g json-server and set the port to 8000 (json-server --watch api/db.json --port 8000)
